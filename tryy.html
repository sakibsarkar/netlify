      <p> <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">

        The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets, but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]

        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.[8]
        
        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.[10]
        
        It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC,[11][12] but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication occurred in Western Asia around 7500 BC.[13]
        
        As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.[14][15] As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned[16][17][18] and around 42 million households own at least one cat.[19] In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.[20]

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">From ancient Egyptians to today’s internet users, people have always loved their cats.

  In the U.S. alone, cats reign over about 45.3 million households. There are at least 45 domestic breeds, which differ widely in features such as coat color, tail length, hair texture, and temperament, according to the Cat Fancier’s Association.
  
  The Maine Coon is the largest, with males reaching an average of 3.5 feet long. The smallest breed is the Singapura, native to Singapore, with adult females weighing as little as four pounds. One of the most unusual-looking cats is the Sphynx, a mostly hairless cat known for being robust and intelligent.
  
  Like their big cat cousins, house cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they have to eat meat to stay healthy. Though they’ve been domesticated for thousands of years, these predators have maintained a strong hunting instinct, relying on stealth to stalk prey and attack with sharp claws and teeth. (Learn surprising things you never knew about your cat.)
  
  As mostly nocturnal animals, cats have excellent vision and hearing, with ears that can turn like satellite dishes. Their reputation for having nine lives stems in part from their ability to navigate difficult environments, for example using their tail to balance and mostly land their lean, muscular bodies on all fours. Cushioning discs between vertebrae also give cat bodies exceptional flexibility and speed.

    <p>Because cats are such smart, sentient creatures, they can have a long list of likes (and, perhaps, an equally long list of dislikes!) In most cases, the things your cat loves are the very same things you love—like fresh, tasty food, long naps in cozy spots, and plenty of fun activities, to name a few.

      Just like us humans, the things cats find interesting, fun, or exciting can change as they age—your cat may love her toy with feathers one day, but find it boring the next. As a kitty parent, it's your job to recognize when your cats' interests change, so you can keep her happy, healthy, and engaged. Although likes can vary from cat to cat, these eight kitty "likes" are a great place to start.
      Stereotypes about cats and their personalities abound—calicos are feisty, orange tabbies are laid back. The Cat Fanciers’ Association has even put together a Breed Personality Chart. The problem with stereotypes is that when looking at an individual, they tend to be wrong as often as they are right.

      Enter science. Research into cat personality types seems to be the topic du jour. The Daily Mail reports that a study involving “interviews” of more than 200 cats and their owners, run by Dr. Lauren Finka of the University of Lincoln in England, reveals that cats have only five personality types. These personalities develop due to “a complex interaction between each cat's genetics and their experiences during development and in adulthood,” the article states. To quote:
    <ul>
      <li>The <b>Human</b> Cat is generally happy to share your home, your life and often your personal space.</li>
      <li>The <b>Hunter Cat</b> is the most feral of the personalities, regularly interacting with realistic cat toys and showing signs of an expert hunter.</li>
      <li>You can identify a <b>Cat's Cat</b> through its willingness to play with and groom its furry siblings, touching noses and rubbing up against each other.</li>
      <li>The <b>Inquisitive Cat</b> can be a keen investigator, sniffing around anything and anyone unfamiliar.</li>
    </ul></section></p>
